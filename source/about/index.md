Hi, nice to meet you! I write software and make things. I can usually be found programming during the week and biking, hiking, or climbing on the weekends. Sometimes I write about side projects. I'm currently freelancing and looking for cool opportunities in NYC (physical computing, interactive art, user experience, etc). Don't hesitate to drop me a line at markneub+web@gmail.com.
